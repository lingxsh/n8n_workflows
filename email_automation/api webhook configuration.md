## 🔑 Two Ways to Handle Signups in n8n

### **Option 1: Webhook Node (n8n listens automatically)**

* Use when: Your **application can notify n8n directly** whenever a signup happens.
* Flow:

  1. User signs up in your product.
  2. Your backend calls the **n8n webhook URL** (like `https://n8n.yourserver.com/webhook/signup`) with the signup data.
  3. n8n receives that data → sends a welcome email.

👉 Here, **n8n is waiting (listening)** for signups.

---

### **Option 2: HTTP Request Node (n8n makes the signup request itself)**

* Use when: You want n8n to **create a user** in your app by calling your product’s **signup API endpoint**.
* Flow:

  1. Something triggers n8n (could be webhook, schedule, manual).
  2. n8n calls your product’s **API endpoint** (e.g., `POST https://api.myproduct.com/signup`) with the user data.
  3. If signup is successful, n8n continues the workflow (send email, etc).

👉 Here, **n8n is the one making the signup happen**.

## 🖼️ Now, Your Screenshot (Webhook Node Details)

### 1. **Test URL vs Production URL**

* **Test URL**: Used when you are *building* the workflow. Only works while the workflow is in **Test mode**. (Example: `http://localhost:5678/webhook-test/...`)
* **Production URL**: Used when the workflow is **Active/Published**. This is the real URL your app’s backend should call when a user signs up.

👉 While testing → use **Test URL**.
👉 After activating workflow → give your backend team the **Production URL**.

---

### 2. **Path**

* This is the **endpoint name**.
* Example: If you set **Path = signup**, then your webhook URL becomes:

  ```
  https://n8n.yourserver.com/webhook/signup
  ```
* Keep it simple, like: `signup` or `user-signup`.

---

### 3. **HTTP Method**

* Select **POST** (because signup data will be sent in the request body).

---

### 4. **Authentication**

* Default = None (but you can protect your webhook if needed).

---

### 5. **Respond**

* **Immediately** → n8n responds instantly when it receives the webhook.
* **When Last Node Finishes** → n8n waits until your whole workflow finishes before responding.
  👉 For signup, **Immediately** is usually fine.

---

### 6. **Options**

* **Allowed Origins (CORS)** → restrict which websites can call this webhook.
* **IP(s) Whitelist** → allow only certain servers to send requests.
* **Raw Body** → keep data exactly as received.
* Most of these you can leave empty as a beginner.

## 🔗 So, Webhook URL vs API Endpoint — What’s the difference?

* **Webhook URL (from n8n)** = Where *your application* sends signup notifications.
* **API Endpoint (from your product)** = Where *n8n* can create or fetch signups.

👉 You don’t need to use both together unless your product **cannot send webhook events**.

* If your **product can send a webhook** → Just give it the n8n Production URL.
* If your **product cannot send a webhook** → Use the HTTP Request node in n8n to call the signup API directly.
